The Underground Game - Poker Table Manager

Overview:
The Underground Game is an interactive web-based poker table manager designed to manage the poker table environment. It allows players to enter their names, choose their icons, buy-in, and cash-out with real-time updates on the cash pool of the game. The web application also includes a Winners & Losers page that tracks the total buy-ins and cash-outs for each player.

Features:

- Add Players: 
  - Players can be added to the table by entering their name and selecting an icon (e.g., card, dice, cash, spades, diamonds, etc.).
  - The game supports up to 10 players at the table.
  
- Buy-In: 
  - Each player can input their buy-in value, which will add to the total money in the game. The buy-in is tracked and updated for each player.
  
- Cash-Out: 
  - Players can cash out, and their total cash is updated in the system. Cash-out amounts are subtracted from the total game pool. If no value is provided for cash-out, it is assumed that the player has cashed out for 0.

- Real-Time Updates: 
  - The game updates the table and the overall cash pool in real time as players buy-in or cash out.

- Winners & Losers: 
  - A dedicated page to track Winners and Losers based on their buy-in and cash-out amounts.
  - Winners are those who cashed out with a profit, while losers have cashed out with a loss.

- Interactive Table: 
  - Players’ icons can be moved around the table, creating a dynamic environment where players can arrange themselves as desired.
